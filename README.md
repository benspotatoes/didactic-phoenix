For free users of [Slack](http://slack.com), only the most recent 10,000
messages are archived. This repo collects messages from Slack channels via
outgoing webhooks and stores them in a database.

## Status

Currently just accepts messages and writes them to the db. Design and additional
functionality to follow!
